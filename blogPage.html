                <p><strong>Ans:</strong> Sure, I'd be happy to discuss the scope of var, let, and const in JavaScript.
                    These are three different ways to declare variables, and they have distinct scoping rules and
                    behaviors.
                </p>
                <p><span class="font-bold">var:</span>
                    Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally-scoped.
                    They are hoisted to the top of their function or global context, which means you can access them
                    before they are declared.
                    If a var variable is declared within a block (inside if statements or loops), it's still accessible
                    outside of that block, which can lead to unintended bugs.
                    var variables can be redeclared within the same scope without any error.</p>

                <p>
                    <span>let:</span>

                    Variables declared with let are block-scoped.
                    They are not hoisted to the top of the block but only to the top of their current scope.
                    let variables can be reassigned, but not redeclared within the same scope.
                    They provide better scoping and prevent accidental variable leaks from blocks.

                <p><strong>Ans:</strong> null and undefined are special values in JavaScript that represent the absence
                    or lack of a value. However, they are used in slightly different contexts. Here are the use cases
                    for each:</p>
                <p>
                    <b> undefined:</b>

                    undefined is a primitive value that indicates a variable has been declared but has not been assigned
                    a value.
                    It is the default value of variables that have been declared but not initialized.
                    It's also what a function returns if there is no explicit return value.
                </p>
             
                <p>
                    <b>null:</b>

                    null is also a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any value or an empty
                    value.
                    It's often used to indicate that a variable intentionally does not have a value.
                    It's a way to explicitly assign "nothing" to a variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, undefined is usually the default value for uninitialized variables and the absence of
                    return values, while null is often used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or to reset a
                    variable to no value. It's important to use these values correctly to ensure your code's behavior is
                    clear and intentional.

            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content mb-10 p-10 bg-slate-400 rounded-md shadow-lg shadow-black">
                <p> <strong>Ans:</strong> REST stands for "Representational State Transfer," and it is an architectural
                    style or set of constraints for designing networked applications. A RESTful API (Application
                    Programming Interface) is an API that adheres to the principles of REST, allowing communication
                    between different software applications over the internet.</p>
